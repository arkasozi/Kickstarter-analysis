# Kickstarter-analysis
Analyzing Kickstarter data to get the correlation between the launch dates and fundiung goals using kickstarter data
Most of the plays were a success expecially the plays that started in the second and third quarter, Projects that received the desired funding were more likely to meet succeed and the projects that were cancelled mainly failed to get the funds necesarry to run the production, the data. Projects had an average span of 45 days and were cancelled if they failed to get the funds
Successful projects usually required less funds and what was pledged was usally above the set goal
I think with the budget of 4000 dollars, Louise will be able to stage a successful play provided they start in the second quarter and get the required funs
